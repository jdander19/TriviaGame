I have been struggling to catch back up after winter break and being sick for most of the last 2/3 weeks. Ive gotten back to the point where I think Im recalling and working out a lot of the coding. I had started bakwards mimicing a completed code I found and to make my own version of it to avoide it looking like a complete copy and paste job.

I got pretty far with it and added my own look and rearagned a grouped array of questinos, options, and answers but could not get it to work again in the new formmat and with other outside interferane ran out of time. Hopefully most of it is there and Ive at least realized how to simplify a timer and get it to run even if I couldnt get the questions to reappear. I suspect I needed a for loop by the end of it.
